Problem Statement
Let's define two functions G(X) and F(X) where G(X) will give us the closest prime greater than or equal to X and F(X) will give us the smallest digit (0-9) in X.

Given two integers N and M, Your task is to print the value the sum of values of F(G(i)) for each I from N to M.

Note:-
We have already provided you the function G(X) which returns the closest prime greater than or equal to X. To use the given function you have to call next_prime(x).

Note:- Do not close your main class.

Input
The input contains two space- separated integers depicting the values of N and M.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= M <= 10000

Output
Print the sum of F(G(i)) for each i from N to M.

Example
Sample Input:-
1 10

Sample Output:-
34

Explanation:-
Numbers:- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
G(i):- 2 2 3 5 5 7 7 11 11 11
F(G(i)):- 2 2 3 5 5 7 7 1 1 1
Sum=34

Sample Input:-
8 11

Sample Output:-
4
