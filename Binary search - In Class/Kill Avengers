Problem Statement
In a new plot by Hydra to kill the avengers, Doctor Zola comes up with a new form of poison composed of chromosomes A, C, T and G. The poison is a string of length n (where n is divisible by 4) with each of the four letters occurring exactly n/4 times. For example, GACT and AAGTGCCT are both fatal poisons.Help Doctor Zolaâ€™s plan by choosing one (maybe empty) substring of minimal length in given poision and replace it with the new string (containing A,T,G,C) to make that poison fatal quickly.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N. The next line of input contains a string S of size N.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 100000

Note:- N is divisible by 4 and S will only contain {A, G, C, T}
Output
Print the length of the minimum length substring that can be replaced to detect the poison as fatal.
